* Instant Spa√ü With Instaparse

  Talking about parser generators with Instaparse in Clojure

* Abstract

Instaparse is a Clojure library for generating parsers from a
context-free grammar. It implements a GLL parser, takes grammars in
ABNF or EBNF and can create grammars at runtime. Without an additional
compile step and due to the flexible input format and some useful
additions, Instaparse is particularly pleasant to use. This talk
introduces Instaparse with simple examples, continues with real-world
examples and finally explores the dynamic nature of Instaparse.
